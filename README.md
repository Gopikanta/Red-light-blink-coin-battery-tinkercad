# Red-light-blink-coin-battery-tinkercad

## Overview

This is a self-learning exercise to understand basic electronics concepts using Tinkercad, a free online circuit simulation tool. The circuit demonstrates how a red LED is powered using a CR2032 coin battery with a resistor to control the current.

## Components Used

* Coin Cell Battery (CR2032) — 3V
* Red LED
* Resistor — 100 Ohms

## Circuit Logic

The battery supplies 3V to the circuit. Current flows from the positive terminal through the resistor, then through the LED, and back to the negative terminal. The resistor protects the LED by limiting the current.


## Resistor Calculation

* R = (Supply Voltage − LED Voltage) ÷ LED Current
* R = (3V − 2V) ÷ 0.010A = 100 Ohms

## Key Learnings

* How a basic LED circuit works
* The role of a resistor in protecting an LED
* Difference between a coin battery and a 9V battery
* How to simulate circuits using Tinkercad
